An Organism Requires Energy and Nutrient  Input  Energy is required in order to build molecules into larger  macromolecules (like proteins), and to turn macromolecules into  organelles and cells, which then turn into tissues, organs, and organ  systems, and finally into an organism. Proper nutrition provides  the necessary nutrients to make the energy that supports life’s  processes. Your body builds new macromolecules from the  nutrients in food.  Nutrient and Energy Flow  Energy is stored in a nutrient’s chemical bonds. Energy comes from  sunlight, which plants capture and, via photosynthesis, use it to  transform carbon dioxide in the air into the molecule glucose. When  the glucose bonds are broken, energy is released. Bacteria, plants,  and animals (including humans) harvest the energy in glucose via a  biological process called cellular respiration. In this process oxygen  is required and the chemical energy of glucose is gradually released  in a series of chemical reactions. Some of this energy is trapped  in the molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and some is lost as  heat. ATP can be used when needed to drive chemical reactions in  cells that require an input of energy. Cellular respiration requires  oxygen (aerobic) and it is provided as a byproduct of photosynthesis.  The byproducts of cellular respiration are carbon dioxide (CO2) and  water, which plants use to conduct photosynthesis again. Thus,  carbon is constantly cycling between plants and animals.
